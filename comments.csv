This guy did more for selling ME on trying Intel again after 23 years of only buying AMD than the CEO ever could. This is how you talk to people humble acknowledge where the challenges are and admit that sometimes manufacturing misses the mark for delivery. He did a real good job of showing how they apply lessons learnt. If the CEO could take lessons from this guy on demeanor when doing interviews or on stage. He could sell a lot more processors. Drop the arrogance. Is that too much to ask?,23-Jan,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fVU-m5TdFI,positive,Intel processor binning explained by Guy Therien | Talking Tech

"Ok, so I'm a 3d animator and my studio just build 3 new Pc rigs for the new animators with i7 12700 32Gb ram and RTX 3060 and they have a task to test some shots with two character rigs (heavy rigs with lots of deformation) in it, and I'm in a shocked that those intel build can run 20-ish fps on Maya viewport. Meanwhile, our older build with 24cores Threadrypper 64Gb ram and 2070 super only manages to run below 10fps in Maya viewport. Do you think it's because of the P-cores and E-cores involvement here?

Because the next time I build a new PC or laptop I will make sure to get that 12th or new 13th gen Intel for sure.",23-Jan,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq1P73bdilY,positive,13th Gen ‘Raptor Lake’ Full Mobile and Desktop Family Overview | Talking Tech
